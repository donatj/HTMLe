<p><strong>What is HTMLe</strong><br />
  You&rsquo;ve just built a WordPress website for your client, or provided them  with a custom CMS and then they say&hellip; &ldquo;we want to add a feed on this  page to cnn.com, and a feed on this page to yahoo.com.&rdquo;&nbsp; Or they say,  &ldquo;wow, this is great, but can we add our twitter feed to this page only&rdquo;  or &ldquo;can we hook this up to our store database and show products for  this category on this page, and a different category on this page?&rdquo;&nbsp;  Unfortunately, clients do not seem to realize that these are database  driven sites, meaning the content is simply being pulled out of the  database and thrown into a single, templated page.</p>
<p>It was from this lack of understanding that HTMLe, the plugin engine  was built.&nbsp; Similar to Smarty&rsquo;s plugin engine, HTMLe allows you to  build a single plugin which is called by a &ldquo;smart tag&rdquo; and accepts  unlimited attributes.&nbsp; But HTMLe takes it one step further as it allows  you to call sub-functions individually, as well as use a class instead  of a function&hellip; giving you even more control over your plugin and  allowing for even greater code reusability.</p>
<p>For example, by default the RSS READER plugin is included.&nbsp; To add  an RSS feed to a page you would simply add { rssreader  url=&rdquo;http://www.mikestowe.com/feed/&rdquo; posts=&rdquo;5&Prime; words=&rdquo;25&Prime; endwith=&rdquo;&hellip;&rdquo;  }&nbsp; This would then display 5 posts (with upto 25 words) from the  Mikestowe.com feed.&nbsp; Of course you can take even greater advantage of  this &ldquo;HTMLe tag&rdquo; by adding the skip attribute (skips the first # of  words) and the style attribute (let&rsquo;s you completely style how the  individual posts are displayed).</p>
<p><strong><br />
  Installing HTMLe</strong><br />
  HTMLe can be installed as a WordPress plugin or standalone on any server running PHP 5.</p>
<p><img title="wordpress_icon" src="http://www.mikestowe.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/wordpress_icon.png" alt="WORDPRESS" width="50" align="absmiddle" height="50" /> To install as a <strong>WordPress</strong> plugin:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Install the HTMLe folder in the wp-content/plugins/ folder</li>
  <li>CHMOD the HTMLe/plugins folder and its contents to 777 to enable  plugin creation and editing (this can be skipped for security purposes)</li>
  <li>Activate the plugin through the WordPress admin panel (under plugins)</li>
</ol>
<p><img title="php-icon" src="http://www.mikestowe.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/php-icon.gif" alt="PHP" width="50" align="absmiddle" height="50" />To install as a <strong>stand alone</strong> plugin for a custom CMS/ DDW:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Install the HTMLe folder somewhere in your site&rsquo;s directory</li>
  <li>If you do not have autoload setup for this location, include the HTMLe.php file (you only need to do this once)</li>
  <li>Wrap your output code in the HTMLe function or class
    <ul>
        <li> <span class="style1">&lt;?php</span>&nbsp;<span class="style2">HTMLe_process</span>(<span class="style3">$output</span>);&nbsp;<span class="style1">?&gt;</span> <em><strong>- OR -</strong></em></li>
      <li> <span class="style1">&lt;?php</span>&nbsp;<span class="style3">$HTMLe</span>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span class="style4">new</span>&nbsp;<span class="style2">HTMLe</span>;&nbsp;<span class="style2"><span class="style3">$HTMLe</span><span class="style4">-&gt;</span>parse</span>(<span class="style3">$output</span>);&nbsp;<span class="style1">?&gt;</span></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Coding Restrictions<br />
</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>HTMLe tags may not contain a space between the opening bracket and the HTMLe tag (for example, { rssreader} will not work</li>
  <li>You may only use quotations when referring to attributes, and they  may not be used outside of defining an attribute.&nbsp; It is recommended to  use apostrophes (&lsquo;) inside of an attribute when needed.&nbsp; For example, {  rssreader style=&rdquo;&lt;a href=&rdquo;&quot;&gt;&rdquo;} will not work.&nbsp; However you may  also use HTMLe smart tags to do this, so in the case of =&rdquo; you can use  (( and in the case of &rdquo; you can use )) or { rssreader style=&rdquo;&lt;a  href((%link%))&gt;&rdquo;}</li>
  <li>You may only use attributes ({tag attribute=&quot;value&quot;}) OR textarea style HTMLe tags ({tag}{/tag}). If a tag contains an ending tag ({/tag}), it will be assumed to be a textarea style tag and all attributes will be ignored, with only $params['_inner'] being returned (regardless if there is any text between the start and end tag or not). I am hoping to resolve this is a future release. </li>
